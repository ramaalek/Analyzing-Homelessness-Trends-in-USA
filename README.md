This project explores the systemic roots and demographic impact of homelessness across the U.S. using HUD, Zillow, and Census data. Through interactive Tableau dashboards, we uncover how housing costs, shelter availability, and social factors shape the crisis.

What the Project Covers
1. State-level homelessness rates to identify high-need regions
2. Demographic breakdowns by age, gender, and race
3. Trends in veteran homelessness and the impact of federal programs
4. Rental price trends vs. homelessness rates to show affordability issues
5. Shelter capacity gaps in top-impacted states
